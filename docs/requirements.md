# Requirements

## Basic Requirements

- Project name: Coda
- CLI tool that agents can use to interact with the system
- Tauri-based UI that a user can use to interact with the agents, especially for human-in-the-loop tasks, issue tracking and annotation on plans
- Alert system that notifies users of human-in-the-loop tasks
- Issue-tracker integration with Jira or Linear
- Personal preferences: Claude is good for most of the time, but Codex is better for coding, debugging, troubleshooting, and structured code reviews.

## Milestones

- Milestone 1: Basic functionality through claude code/codex skills, subagents and basic UI for plan annotation
- Milestone 2: Advanced functionality through CLI and alert system
- Milestone 3: Enhanced functionality through Jira integration and improved UI for human-in-the-loop tasks
